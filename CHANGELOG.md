# ThinkGraph Starter Kit Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Core Visualization Libraries**: Integrated essential libraries for data visualization and analysis:
  - `ag-grid-community` and `ag-grid-react` for robust data grids.
  - `cytoscape` and `react-cytoscapejs` for graph and network visualizations.
  - `reactflow` for building interactive node-based editors and diagrams.

### Changed
- **Simplified UI Template**: The main UI component (`App.tsx`) has been streamlined to a minimal starting point, featuring a clean "ThinkGraph Starter Kit" heading. This removes the demo content and provides a clear foundation for new projects.
