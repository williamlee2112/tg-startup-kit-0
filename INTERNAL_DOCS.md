# Internal Documentation for the ThinkGraph App Dev Starter Kit

This document explains the internal structure and technology stack of this repository. This project is not a web application itself, but a command-line tool that builds web applications based on a powerful, opinionated template.

## Core Technology Stack

The template generated by this tool is built on a modern, type-safe, and performant technology stack:

* **Architecture:** Hybrid React model using **React Server Components (RSC)** for data fetching and server-side logic.
* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite.
* **Backend API:** Hono (running on Node.js).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI components.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with the **Apache AGE** extension for graph capabilities.
* **ORM / Data Access:** **Drizzle ORM** for a type-safe relational application SDK.
* **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication.
* **Testing:** Vitest and Puppeteer.

## Key Visualization Libraries

The template comes pre-installed with a suite of best-in-class visualization libraries:

* **Cytoscape.js:** The primary engine for high-performance, interactive graph visualizations. Used for displaying complex network data.
* **AG Grid:** A feature-rich data grid for displaying and manipulating large, complex tabular datasets.
* **React Flow:** A specialized library for building interactive node-based editors, flowcharts, and diagrams where user interaction is key.

## Key Tool Directories

* **`src/` (The Source Code)**
    This is the heart of the installer tool. It contains all the TypeScript source code that defines the installer's logic.

* **`temp-template/` (The "Blueprint")**
    This is the most important folder for customization. It contains a complete "blueprint" of the application that our tool creates. Any change you want to be present in all future projects (like adding new libraries) should be made to the files inside `temp-template/`.

* **`dist/` (The Compiled Code)**
    This folder contains the final, compiled JavaScript code that Node.js actually executes. The `pnpm run build` command compiles the code from `src/` into this directory.

* **`bin/` (The Entry Point)**
    This folder contains the `cli.js` script that acts as the entry point when you run the installer from the command line.
